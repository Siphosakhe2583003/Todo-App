# 🧩 GO-DO Board

> This isn’t a Todo app.  
> It’s a Trello-style board I started building to learn Go… but somehow got *way* too into the frontend 😅  
> Honestly? I should’ve just made it a TUI app. But hey, what’s done is done (and yeah, I’m still working on it).

## 🚀 What's GO-DO?

GO-DO is a **kanban-style task board** — think Trello, but powered by **Go** on the backend and some surprisingly clean frontend work.  
The goal was simple: Learn Go.  
The result? A fullstack board app with cards, columns, drag-and-drop, Firebase auth, Firestore DB, a containerized backend and a surprisingly polished UI.

Funny how side projects do that to you, huh?

## 🛠️ Built With:

- 🧠 **Go (Fiber)** — Handles all the backend logic, APIs, and the "boring but important" stuff.  
- ⚛️ **React (yes... plain JavaScript) + CSS** — I skipped Tailwind because *"ITS USELESS"* That said, I’ll give it a proper try before I roast it completely.  
- 🔐 **Firebase Auth + Firestore** — Easy setup for auth and DB… until you realize Firebase Hosting doesn’t support real env vars. Thanks, Google. Real secure.  
- 🐳 **Docker + Google Cloud Run** — Docker? Love it. Cloud Run? Tried it so you don’t have to. Let’s just say it’s not my favorite GCP service and leave it at that.

## ✨ Features

- ✅ Drag-and-drop cards like a pro
- ✅ Create, edit, and delete boards, columns, and tasks
- ✅ Authenticated sessions with Firebase
- ✅ Clean UI that *might* have stolen your productivity

## 🤓 Why I Made This

Originally? I just wanted to learn Go.

But then I started tweaking a bit of frontend stuff… then Firebase got involved… then Docker… and now here we are — shipping a full project and pretending it was always the plan.

This was *the* project that taught me how to:

- Actually learn to use Docker
- Build fullstack apps from scratch
- Over-engineer a side project because it’s fun
- Wasting time on a silly project
- DEVOPS (Setting up GCP is a chore and I'll never use it again)
- Caching(Redis) and Rate limiting for protection against DDoS because some people are just board(See what I did there)

## 🧪 Still Cooking

- 🎨 More polish on drag-and-drop UX  
- 🪓 Clean up error handling (aka make logs less of a horror show)  
- 🧼 Refactor the code that I wrote at 2am
- 📱 **Might** make it responsive on mobile (not likely, but hey, it could happen)
- ⌨️ Add VIM mode so that I could use it with just the keyboard (I use **NEOVIM** btw)

## 💭 Random Thoughts

> “Should’ve just built a terminal app.” — me, repeatedly, with increasing regret.

I mean… a TUI *would* have taught me a lot — probably the same Go stuff, maybe even a bit of Docker magic too.  
But let’s be real: I was always gonna be the only one using it.  
(That still holds true for this one, by the way.)

At least this way I get to pretend I’m building something “scalable” while debugging CSS for 2 hours straight.
